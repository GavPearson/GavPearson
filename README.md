## About me:
After many years mastering Excel, I have recently stept into the world of Power BI. In August 2024 I completed a 16 week Skills for Life Bootcamp with [Cenit College](https://www.cenitcollege.co.uk/course/data-analytics-with-powerbi-bootcamp/). 
# Data Analytics with Power BI
You can use this [link](https://github.com/GavPearson/Power-BI-Bike-Sales-) to view my first GitHub repository which contains the Power BI file and raw data file. The web browser dashboard and mobile report look like this.
